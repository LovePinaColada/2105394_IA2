			<p>My Hero is the Batman. The reason for this is because he demostrates what I strive to be - not just in terms of school but as a man in general. Being able to push pass all adversities in life, all the trauma, wrong doings and hurt that you have faced by believing in your strength and knowing good things will come and happpen for you in the end is exactly what Batman is about. My favourite scence is the ending monolouge from The Batman 2022 as it encapsulates all that I've said about him.</p>

			<p>I believe that this test is valid in saying that I am an idealist according to this test. i am observant and take note of the little this to see how they can help me in school as well as in life with partners,friends and family. 
			Intuitiveness is also fair as I have mostly used my feelings and instincts and basic understanding to come to conclusions and answers in and outside of school. </p>
